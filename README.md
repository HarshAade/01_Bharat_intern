# Predictive Modeling Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase the results of my predictive modeling projects. In this repository, you will find two exciting projects:

## Project 1: Stock Price Prediction

**Task 1: Tesla Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression**

- **Project Description:** In this project, I developed a Linear Regression model to predict Tesla's stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data and market factors, I created a model that estimates Tesla's stock price trends, which can assist investors in their decision-making process.

**Task 2: Google Stock Price Prediction with LSTM**

- **Project Description:** In Task 2, I focused on predicting Google's stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. I leveraged historical stock data to develop a time series forecasting model that helps investors make informed decisions.

## Project 2: Titanic Survival Classification

- **Project Description:** This project is centered around predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. I built a classification system that determines whether a person would have survived the tragic sinking. The predictive model analyzes various factors, including socio-economic status, age, gender, and more, to identify the key factors contributing to survival.
